Afterwards, Cyclops sends them to sentry in a rate that's calculated using sentry's own response time as basis.\r\n\r\nCyclops\r\n=======\r\n\r\nCyclops is a router of sentry error reporting requests. It receives error reports, keeps them in-memory (or any other storage you implement) and sends to your sentry backend in regular intervals.\r\n\r\nIt takes into account the time your sentry backend is taking to service each request when calculating the interval with which to send the next request, thus making sure you don't flood your sentry backend.\r\n\r\nIn preliminary load testing, a server with 23 instances of Cyclops running handled more than 12 thousand requests per second.\r\n\r\nInstalling\r\n==========\r\n\r\nInstalling Cyclops is as easy as:\r\n\r\n    $ pip install cyclops\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n=====\r\n\r\nCyclops comes with a console app called 'cyclops' (pretty imaginative bunch, aren't we?).\r\n\r\n    $ cyclops --help\r\n    usage: cyclops [-h] [--port PORT] [--bind BIND] [--conf CONF] [--verbose]\r\n                 [--debug]\r\n\r\n    optional arguments:\r\n      -h, --help            show this help message and exit\r\n      --port PORT, -p PORT  Port to start the server with.\r\n      --bind BIND, -b BIND  IP to bind the server to.\r\n      --conf CONF, -c CONF  Path to configuration file.\r\n      --verbose, -v         Log level: v=warning, vv=info, vvv=debug.\r\n      --debug, -d           Indicates whether to run tornado in debug mode.\r\n\r\nThe arguments are self-explanatory. The key argument is the configuration file.\r\n\r\nConfiguration\r\n=============\r\n\r\nThe configuration file is where you tell Cyclops how to behave, how to store data, how to connect to sentry, etc.\r\n\r\n    ################################### General ####################################\r\n\r\n    ## Cyclops has a /healthcheck route.

Both the `GET` and `POST` routes.\r\n\r\nYou can send the errors to Cyclops in *EXACTLY* the same way you would send to sentry.\r\n\r\nThere's one additional route, though: `/count`.\r\n\r\nThis route returns a JSON object that tells you how that specific Cyclops instance is doing (how many messages to process, average and percentile response time).\r\n\r\nAn example output of the `/count` route:\r\n\r\n    {\r\n        count: 0, // Messages to be sent to sentry\r\n        average: 77.491357729, // Average response time for sentry requests\r\n        percentile: 72.9767654253, // 90% Percentil of response time for sentry requests\r\n        processed: 10, // Number of processed sentry errors for this cyclops process\r\n        ignored: 300 // Number of ignored sentry errors for this cyclops process\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\nStorage\r\n=======\r\n\r\nCyclops allows users to specify any storage mechanism they want for storing messages before sending them to sentry. It comes bundled with in-memory and redis storages, but it's pretty simple to implement a new storage class, say for MemCached.\r\n\r\nA storage class has to implement the following interface:\r\n\r\n    def __init__(self, application):\r\n        # stores application for further usage\r\n        # and does any initialization needed\r\n\r\n    def put(self, project_id, message):\r\n        # stores the message for later processing for the given project\r\n\r\n    def get_size(self, project_id):\r\n        # returns the size of the \"queue\" for a given project\r\n\r\n    def get_next_message(self):\r\n        # gets the next message to process, independent of project\r\n        # usually this is done in a round-robin fashion among projects\r\n\r\n    def mark_as_done(self, project_id):\r\n        # indicates to the \"queue\" that this message is done processing\r\n        # which means it has been sent to sentry\r\n\r\n    @property\r\n    def total_size(self):\r\n        # returns the total size of all project queues\r\n\r\n    @property\r\n    def available_queues(self):\r\n        # returns a list of project ids\r\n\r\n\r\nCaching\r\n=======\r\n\r\nBesides allowing users to store messages wherever they want, Cyclops allows for extensible cache implementations as well.\r\n\r\nCaching in Cyclops is a little different than what you might be used to. It is used as a mechanism for dropping messages that might flood your sentry farm.\r\n\r\nConsider what would happen if you had a page that gets hit 1000 times each second and you introduce a javascript error in it. You would get millions of VERY similar messages flooding your farm by the time you got to fix it.\r\n\r\nCyclops uses the caching implementation to prevent that. If it detects that the given key (for GET requests it's the URL, for POST requests it's the Project Id + Culprit) has been processed more than `MAX_CACHE_USES` in the last `URL_CACHE_EXPIRATION` seconds it will discard it.\r\n\r\nConsider an expiration of 1 second with 10 max cache uses. This means that if the same key arrives more than 10 times each second, the 11th, 12th and so on will be discarded. After the second ellapses, the cache key is discarded and we start processing messages again.\r\n\r\nIt might seem weird to process only 1% of the error requests (1000 reqs/sec and we process 10/sec), but most likely that 1% should be enough info to allow you to fix the problem.\r\n\r\nImplementing a Custom Cache is very simple, even though Cyclops comes bundled with a very efficient Redis cache implementation. Your cache needs to conform to this interface:\r\n\r\n    def __init__(self, application):\r\n        # stores application for further usage\r\n        # and does any initialization needed\r\n\r\n    def get(self, key):\r\n        # gets a key usages.\r\n        # should return an integer if key is found, None otherwise\r\n\r\n    def incr(self, key):\r\n        # should increment the number of times a key has been used by 1\r\n\r\n    def set(self, key, expiration):\r\n        # should set a key to 0 and set it's expiration to \"expiration\" seconds\r\n\r\n\r\ncyclops-count\r\n=============\r\n\r\nUsing the `/count` route, we can keep track of the performance of individual Cyclops instances and of the load of each of them. It would be a tedious task to track the load and performance of each instance, though.\r\n\r\nCyclops comes with a helper program that allows you to specify a server and a range of ports representing Cyclops instances, like this:\r\n\r\n    $ cyclops-count -b http://localhost -p 9000-9004\r\n\r\nThis command would return output similar to:\r\n\r\n    localhost:9000 has still 10 messages to process\r\n    localhost:9001 has still 10 messages to process\r\n    localhost:9002 has still 10 messages to process\r\n    localhost:9003 has still 10 messages to process\r\n    localhost:9004 has still 10 messages to process\r\n\r\n    Total of 50 messages to send to [sentry](http://getsentry.com) from the farm at localhost.\r\n\r\n    Total 300 processed items and 3000 ignored items (10.00%).\r\n    Average sentry response time is 2918.66ms and 90% Percentile is 2339.53ms\r\n\r\nThis way you can keep track of how your farm is doing *A LOT* easier.\r\n\r\nHosting\r\n=======\r\n\r\nThe way we are hosting Cyclops is pretty standard.\r\n\r\nWe have a [supervisor](http://supervisord.org/) instance that starts 24 instances of Cyclops in ports ranging from 9100 to 9123.\r\n\r\nWe then use NGinx to load-balance traffic to them, and use the NGinx port to send sentry traffic to. If anyone is interested in a sample configuration for both supervisor and NGinx, just create an issue.\r\n\r\nContributing\r\n============\r\n\r\nIf you wish to contribute to Cyclops, file and issue or send us a pull request.\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n=======\r\n\r\nCyclops is licensed under the MIT License:\r\n\r\nThe MIT License\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2013 Bernardo Heynemann heynemann@gmail.com\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
