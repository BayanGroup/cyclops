<h1>Disclaimer</h1>

<p>I am a huge fan of <a href="http://getsentry.com">sentry</a> and it has literally changed the level of quality of all my apps that use it, web or not.</p>

<p>Huge props to the whole team behind it and to <a href="https://github.com/disqus" class="user-mention">@disqus</a> for releasing it to the public as open source, thus allowing us to better understand how it works.</p>

<h1>The Issue</h1>

<p>That said, if you have a volume of requests as large as we do (&gt; 5000 requests/second), a single Javascript error being tracked by <a href="http://getsentry.com">sentry</a> could bring our whole <a href="http://getsentry.com">sentry</a> farm down.</p>

<p>We did some extensive Load Testing with <a href="http://getsentry.com">sentry</a> and the results will be available to everyone soon. It's just not viable for us to have <a href="http://getsentry.com">sentry</a> as the Front End to our error reporting.</p>

<p>We needed something that could handle tens of thousands of error reporting requests per second, then send it to <a href="http://getsentry.com">sentry</a> in a rate that it can process.</p>

<h1>Cyclops</h1>

<p>Cyclops is a router of <a href="http://getsentry.com">sentry</a> error reporting requests. It receives error reports, keeps them in-memory (or any other storage you implement) and sends to your <a href="http://getsentry.com">sentry</a> backend in regular intervals.</p>

<p>It takes into account the time your <a href="http://getsentry.com">sentry</a> backend is taking to service each request when calculating the interval with which to send the next request, thus making sure you don't flood your <a href="http://getsentry.com">sentry</a> backend.</p>

<p>In our Load Testing, a server with 23 instances of Cyclops running handled more than 12 thousand requests per second.</p>

<h1>Installing</h1>

<p>Installing Cyclops is as easy as:</p>

<pre><code>$ pip install cyclops
</code></pre>

<h1>Usage</h1>

<p>Cyclops comes with a console app called 'cyclops' (pretty imaginative bunch, aren't we?).</p>

<pre><code>$ cyclops --help
usage: cyclops [-h] [--port PORT] [--bind BIND] [--conf CONF] [--verbose]
             [--debug]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --port PORT, -p PORT  Port to start the server with.
  --bind BIND, -b BIND  IP to bind the server to.
  --conf CONF, -c CONF  Path to configuration file.
  --verbose, -v         Log level: v=warning, vv=info, vvv=debug.
  --debug, -d           Indicates whether to run tornado in debug mode.
</code></pre>

<p>The arguments are pretty explanatory. The key argument is the configuration file.</p>

<h1>Configuration</h1>

<p>The configuration file is where you tell Cyclops how to behave, how to store data, how to connect to <a href="http://getsentry.com">sentry</a>, etc.</p>

<pre><code>################################### General ####################################

## Cyclops has a /healthcheck route. This allows load balancers to ping it to see
## if the process is still alive. This option defines the text that the
## /healthcheck route prints.
## Defaults to: WORKING
#HEALTHCHECK_TEXT = 'WORKING'

## [sentry](http://getsentry.com) server name. This is the base URL that Cyclops will use to send
## requests to [sentry](http://getsentry.com).
## Defaults to: localhost:9000
#[sentry](http://getsentry.com)_BASE_URL = 'localhost:9000'

## Cyclops keeps [sentry](http://getsentry.com)'s projects public and security keys in memory. This
## allows a very fast validation as to whether each request is valid. This
## configuration defines the interval in seconds that Cyclops will update the
## keys.
## Defaults to: 120
#UPDATE_PERIOD = 120

## The storage class used in Cyclops. Storage classes are what define how
## received requests will be treated *before* sending to [sentry](http://getsentry.com). Inherits from
## cyclops.storage.base.Storage. Built-ins: "cyclops.storage.memory" and
## "cyclops.storage.redis."
## Defaults to: cyclops.storage.memory
#STORAGE = 'cyclops.storage.memory'

################################################################################


################################# Performance ##################################

## Cyclops will try to send the errors it receives to [sentry](http://getsentry.com) as fast as possible.
## This is done using a percentile average of 90% of the last [sentry](http://getsentry.com) requests
## time. If those requests were serviced in 30ms average, then Cyclops will
## keep sending requests every 30ms. This setting specify a maximum interval
## in miliseconds to send requests to [sentry](http://getsentry.com).
## Defaults to: 1000
#MAX_DUMP_INTERVAL = 1000

## In order to calculate the average requests, Cyclops keeps track of the times
## of the last requests sent to [sentry](http://getsentry.com). This setting specifies the maximum
## number of requests to average.
## Defaults to: 5000
#MAX_REQUESTS_TO_AVERAGE = 5000

################################################################################


################################### Database ###################################

## Host of your [sentry](http://getsentry.com) installation MySQL database.
## Defaults to: localhost
#MYSQL_HOST = 'localhost'

## Port of your [sentry](http://getsentry.com) installation MySQL database.
## Defaults to: 3306
#MYSQL_PORT = 3306

## Database of your [sentry](http://getsentry.com) installation MySQL database.
## Defaults to: [sentry](http://getsentry.com)
#MYSQL_DB = '[sentry](http://getsentry.com)'

## User of your [sentry](http://getsentry.com) installation MySQL database.
## Defaults to: root
#MYSQL_USER = 'root'

## Password of your [sentry](http://getsentry.com) installation MySQL database.
## Defaults to: 
#MYSQL_PASS = ''

<h1>The Routes</h1>

<p>Cyclops mymics the <code>api/store</code> routes in <a href="http://getsentry.com">sentry</a>. Both the <code>GET</code> and <code>POST</code> routes.</p>

<p>You can send the errors to Cyclops in <em>EXACTLY</em> the same way you would send to <a href="http://getsentry.com">sentry</a>.</p>

<p>There's one additional route, though: <code>/count</code>.</p>

<p>This route returns a JSON object that tells you how that specific Cyclops instance is doing (how many messages to process, average and percentile response time).</p>

<p>An example output of the <code>/count</code> route:</p>

<pre><code>{
count: 0,
average: 77.491357729,
percentile: 72.9767654253
}
</code></pre>

<h1>cyclops-count</h1>

<p>Using the <code>/count</code> route, we can keep track of the performance of individual Cyclops instances and of the load of each of them. It would be a tedious task to track the load and performance of each instance, though.</p>

<p>Cyclops comes with a helper program that allows you to specify a server and a range of ports representing Cyclops instances, like this:</p>

<pre><code>$ cyclops-count -b http://localhost -p 9000-9004
</code></pre>

<p>This command would return output similar to:</p>

<pre><code>localhost:9000 has still 10 messages to process
localhost:9001 has still 10 messages to process
localhost:9002 has still 10 messages to process
localhost:9003 has still 10 messages to process
localhost:9004 has still 10 messages to process

Total of 50 messages to send to [sentry](http://getsentry.com) from the farm at localhost.

Average [sentry](http://getsentry.com) response time is 2918.66ms and 90% Percentile is 2339.53ms
</code></pre>

<p>This way you can keep track of how your farm is doing <em>A LOT</em> easier.</p>

<h1>Hosting</h1>

<p>The way we are hosting Cyclops is pretty standard.</p>

<p>We have a <a href="http://supervisord.org/">supervisor</a> instance that starts 24 instances of Cyclops in ports ranging from 9100 to 9123.</p>

<p>We then use NGinx to load-balance traffic to them, and use the NGinx port to send <a href="http://getsentry.com">sentry</a> traffic to. If anyone is interested in a sample configuration for both supervisor and NGinx, just create an issue.</p>
